# Biginner
This is my first python piece of code.
the App.py is a folder for general python runtrue
the calculate_age.py and cal_age_min.py are my first projects written defferently 
#caculate age
we converted the str(birth_year)  to int so it can be substracted.

#Exercise 1
age had to be converted to a str because you can't concatinate a str to an int.

#Exercise2
the computer read the two imputs as str, we had to convert them to int and float, 
datatypes such as str(), int(), bool(), float(). have to  proberly define for concatination.

#str_methods
how str methods/objects are used.

#added Arithmetic operator.
#operator precedence
#operator comparison.
#logical operators

#added if statements.

#weight calculator:
the weight was converted to and int so i can be devided by the float.
also converted was a float, so we added str so it can be concatinated and print out.
if the user types in 'k' the weight will be devide else any other word type it will multiply the weight.

#added while-loop, also in python int can be multiplied to str
